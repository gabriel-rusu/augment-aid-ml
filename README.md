<h3 align="center">AugmentAid</h3>


<p align="center"> AugmentAid is a machine learning project focused on data augmentation techniques. The project aims to enhance the performance of machine learning models by artificially expanding the training dataset. AugmentAid can generate new, diverse examples that help improve model robustness and generalization by applying various transformations to the existing data.

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
Data augmentation is the process of artificially generating new data from existing data, primarily to train new machine learning (ML) models. ML models require large and varied datasets for initial training, but sourcing sufficiently diverse real-world datasets can be challenging because of data silos, regulations, and other limitations. Data augmentation artificially increases the dataset by making small changes to the original data.

AugmentAid implements two data augimentation tehniques emplying a <b><i>Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)</i></b> and an <b><i>Variational AutoEncoder</i></b> to generate new images similar to the <b>FashionMNIST</b> dataset images in order to asses the impact of this techniques on a simple classification model. 

## ⚡ Quick Start <a name="quick_start"></a>

Want to play with these notebooks online without having to install anything? Use any of the following services.

<b>WARNING:</b> Please be aware that these services provide temporary environments: anything you do will be deleted after a while, so make sure you download any data you care about.


## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
